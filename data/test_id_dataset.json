Thank you all for the help and support, keep it going!The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo’s most profitable and prolific franchises in terms of popularity and critical reception, it has spawned numerous titles, spinoffs and other mediums all around. Like many franchises that follow the trilogy pillar, the first game is usually good, then the sequel follows up and it becomes even better than expected, the third ramps it up even further",

I’ve remained dedicated along with a team of pituitary neuro-endocrine experts to raise public awareness and help educate, and in some cases, reeducate the medical community on recognizing the symptoms of a pituitary tumor and/or hormonal issues related to the neuroendocrine system. Pituitary disease is uncommon however, there are commonly four types of pituitary tumors: prolactin-producing tumors, acromegaly, caused by too much growth hormone, Cushing’s disease, too much ACTH causes a secondary disease of too much cortisol hormone, and non-functioning tumors, which have their own set of problems",

But what if it was good What if its a book that has elements that were great and some that happen to be pet peeves of mine? What if I was just having a bad week and my inner red pencil was over agitated? And what if its a book that just isnt entirely my kind of book - but would be totally another persons cup of tea? So, no more stars from me",

   "premise": "The idea of putting the container in the refrigerator is that the residual heat escapes! If it doesn’t escape, how will the container be cooled???Other sites often mention increasing compressor cycle times (fewer compressor startups). Suggestions include having more food/mass in freezer, but only works as long as you maintain good airflow spaces so food cools during cycle and not after (more surface area=good). A block of ice will help, and be useful backup for power failure, but does not have large surface area to mass why a lead brick would be good",
